# Beezy Test

The purpose of the test is build a single page application with React, showing a list of items with some information in each of them, and another page showing detailed information of each item.

I choosed the Breaking Bad API as I love TV Shows and this is one of my favourite one's.

## 💻 Commands

- ### To run the app in DEVELOPMENT mode just execute ```npm run start```
- ### To build the app in PRODUCTION mode just execute ```npm run build```
- ### To make code looks better run ```npm run prettier```
- ### To review the code just execute ```npm run lint```. You can also fix it with ```npm run lint:write```

## 📋 TODO

- Testing (Jest / Enzyme)

## 📝 Future features

- Add a Checkbox Selector component as a new Filter for Seasons
- Add an option to choose the list view mode (now displayed but disabled)
- Add an option to choose how many characters to show at once
- Add pagination for the main page (list)
- Add pagination for the detail page
- Add a function that take an object of the Periodic Table of the Elements to automatically build the Breaking Bad style box titles.
